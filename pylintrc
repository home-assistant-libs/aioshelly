# Reasons disabled:
# format - handled by black
# duplicate-code - unavoidable
# cyclic-import - doesn't test if both import on load
# too-many-* - are not enforced for the sake of readability
# abstract-method - with intro of async there are always methods missing
# inconsistent-return-statements - doesn't handle raise
# wrong-import-order - isort guards this
